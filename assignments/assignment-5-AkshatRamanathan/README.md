# assignment-5-base

# Forked repo for assignment 5

## Steps to follow -

1. Let's take a random DOM tree
2. You create multiple Nodes objects according to your DOM tree manually.
3. After step2, you will have multiple nodes which represent every elements in your DOM tree.So you can start working on your search function.
Search function is the KEY for this assignment, you need to follow the comments professor gave in node.js file. Please pay attention, your search function will return an array of Nodes/
4. Test your search function to see if you get the right results.
5. Transfer provided DOM tree into Nodes and check if search function works.
Cannot use domfunctions like document.getElementById, querySelectorAll, etc.
6. Order of output result is important

## Instructions:

1. Template repo has a node.js file.
2. Implement the search method as per the method documentation.
3. Method documentation is available as comments.
4. Both iterative and recursive solutions are acceptable.

## Grading:

1. Code documentation - 10 Points
2. Search Results - 60 Points
3. Order of the results - 30 Points
