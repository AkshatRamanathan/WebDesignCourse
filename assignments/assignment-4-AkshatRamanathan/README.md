## Assignment 4

Add layout for Assignment 3 web page as per the mock image and convert all CSS to SCSS syntax.

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to learn about CSS positioning, Grid layout / Flexbox, and SCSS features like variables, mixins, inheritance, loops, functions, math operations, etc.
SCSS should be organized into multiple files based on UI features, common elements, and themes.
These SCSS files should be added to a main.scss file and this should be converted to a .css file using sass.
The SCSS should be used to create modular and concise CSS code.
The navbar should be fixed on the viewport.
JavaScript is not required. This will not add more points to this assignment.
Your site should look very close to the attached file on Assignment 3.
You should not use the table element for formatting.
You should add code documentation using SCSS comments.
If any asset required for the page is missing then use the below links for placeholder assets.
Can use icons from material design [Link](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline) even if it doesn't match the UI mock.
GitHub Link: [Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/gngXBTSYLinks) to an external site.
Follow the GitHub link.
Select your email address (the list is scrollable). If your email is not available, skip to the next step and let TAs know about it.
Your git repo should have a .gitignore file excluding log files and README.md with the description of the assignment.

You should have multiple smaller commits.
    1. You should push the assignment to the main/master branch of the assignment repo. Do not submit it on Canvas.
    2. Your assignment will be assessed only based on HTML and SCSS.
